# Cartelo

Teleoperate ROS 2 robot arms using cartesian coordinate inputs from 3D trackers (VR controllers, smartphones, etc.) and 3D mice (3Dconnexion SpaceMouse).

> My goal is to create an imitation learning fine tuning dataset using an UR12e arm and a HTC Vive controller. If you are interested in combining LeRobot with ROS 2 check out [LeROS2](https://github.com/Nico0302/leros2).

## Usage

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    i([Input])
    c([Cartelo])
    ik([IK])
    j([Joints])
    g([Gripper])
    i --> c --> ik --> j
    c --> g
```

Cartelo can take any `PoseStamped` or `TwistStamped` and an optional `Joy` message and output a desired target pose to an Cartesian controller (e.g. FZI Cartesian Controllers, CRISP Controllers, etc.).

To start teleportation, the operator can move the 3D tracking device close to the robot base and press the preconfigured calibration button (i.e. menu button). 
Now all movements will be transferred to the robot as long as the teleportation button (i.e. side grippers) is pressed down.

Additionally, the operator can use the preconfigured buttons or axes to control the gripper.

## Demo

```bash
ros2 launch cartelo demo_so101_cartesian_controllers.launch.py
```
